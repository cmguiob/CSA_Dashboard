# A dashboard on Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) Options

You will find here the data and code used to develop a dashboard in Power BI that displays adoption and effects of CSA practices and services at Climate Smart Villages around the world. It is intended to help individuals and organizations in the design of climate mitigation and adaptation programs. The data was collected by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) from 2017 to 2021 through the [geofarmer App](https://geofarmer.org/welcome).

The dashboard allows interactivity to answer questions such as:
* Where did the experiments take place and what were they about?
* Which practices were adopted, by whom, where and when?
* What are the drivers for adoption or dis-adoption of practices or the reasons for not using services?
* What are the perceived effects of adopting CSA options in the livelihood, food security and gender equity of small agricultural villages?
