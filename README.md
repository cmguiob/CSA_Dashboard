# A dashboard on Climate Smart Options at Climat Smart Villages

Dashboard to explore adoption and effects of climate smart agriculture practices and services. The data was collected by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) from 2017 to 2021 through the [geofarmer App](https://geofarmer.org/welcome).

The dashboard will be open and will allow interactivity to answer questions such as:
* Where did the experiments take place and what were they about?
* Which practices were adopted, by whom, why, where and when?
* What are the effects of adoption of climate smart options in small agricultural villages?

In this repository you will find some examples of the processed data and the R code used to create some of the visualizations, later embedded into a dashboard built and deployed in Power BI.
